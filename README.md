# xFAQs-Next
xFAQs For the New Message Board Beta

Note: Please use the *[Allman Style](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indent_style#Allman_style)* of Indendting.

That will probably be included in a style-guide once I get this set up.

# What is xFAQs-Next?

xFAQs next is my (slow) port of xFAQs into the open domain (again). This is going to port the existing Firefox and Chrome addons into a UserScript so I can stop being an asshole with releases.

The secondary goal is to port the current code over to the current Message Board engine.
