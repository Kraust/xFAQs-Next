# xFAQs-Next
xFAQs For the New Message Board Beta

Note: Please use the *[Allman Style](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indent_style#Allman_style)* of Indendting.
I am trying to convert the code from Kernel to Allman because Allman is more readable.

That will probably be included in a style-guide once I get this set up.

# What is xFAQs-Next?

xFAQs next is my (slow) port of xFAQs into the open domain (again). This is going to port the existing Firefox and Chrome addons into a UserScript so I can stop being an asshole with releases.

The secondary goal is to port the current code over to the current Message Board engine.

# How to contribute

Please skip all of the formalities on Github. If you've followed xFAQs this far you'll know I really *really* **really** hate Github. I'm doing this as a service to you, and I feel like I need to "Fix" xFAQs because it's in a sad / pittiful state.

If you wish to contact me (Judgmenl). Send a message through the normal channels on GameFAQs (either through PM, Blood Money or Hardcore).

# Pre-merge Information.

I will provide TWO items in this repository for the time being.

1. A release of the current xFAQs version (Chrome / Firefox)
2. My ongoing port of xFAQs to a UserScript.

Any serious modification to some of the algorithms I use (mainly the Avatars-Algorithm) should definitely be addressed by me before I'd even consider adding it. All of the other stuff is fair game with a few exceptions.

1. Features should be togglable on the Settings page.
2. Badges may have to be removed, or heavily modified.
