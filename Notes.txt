Settings (localStorage)

Porting this over from the xfaqs Code:

Basic Structure:

{ 	
	"settings": [
		{
			"enableAMP": true,
			"enableTTI": true
		}
	],
	"highlight-groups": [
	
		{
			"groupName": "xFAQs Creator",
			"color": "#FFD9D9",
			"userNames": [ "Judgmenl" ] 
		}
	
	],
	
	"ignored-users": [
			
	],
	
	"signatures": [
			{
				"boards": [""],
				"accounts": [""],
				"signature": "powered by xfaqs"
			}
	]

}

Goal is to combine my other JSON structures into one local storage object. Settings are
Parsed from this data. You should only use the _SETTINGS_ global to store settings.
